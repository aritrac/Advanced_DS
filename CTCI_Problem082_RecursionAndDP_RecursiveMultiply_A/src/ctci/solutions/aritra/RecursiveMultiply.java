/*
 * Question: Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using the * operator (or / operator). You can use addition, subtraction, and bit shifting,
 * but you should minimize the number of those operations.
 * 
 * Solution: This solution is very tricky. Go through the dry run for both the even and odd cases to understand how the approach works.
 * We can think about multiplying 8x7 as doing 8+8+8+8+8+8+8 (or adding 7 eight times). We can also think about it as the number of squares in an 8x7 grid.
 * We can count half the squares and then double it (by adding this count to itself). To count half the squares, we repeat the same process.
 * Of course this doubling only works if the number is in fact even.When it's not even we need to do the counting/ summing from scratch
 * 
 * minProduct(7,8) -> gets 24 from below, and as small is 7 returns 24 + minProduct(7 - 7 >> 1, bigger), that is 24 + minProduct(4,8), that is 24 + 32 = 56
 * 					minProduct(4,8) returns 16 + 16 as small 4 is even
 * 					to
 * 					minProduct(2,8) returns 8 + 8 as small 2 is even
 * 					to
 * 					minProduct(1,8) returns 8 as base case is reached
 * to
 * 
 * minProduct(3,8) -> gets 8 from below, as small is 3 returns 8 + minProduct(3 - 3 >> 1, bigger), that is 8 + minProduct(2,8), that is 8 + 16 = 24
 * 					minProduct(2,8) return 8 + 8 which is returned from below which is 16
 * 					to
 * 					minProduct(1,8) returns 8 as base case is reached
 * 
 * to
 * 
 * minProduct(1,8) //Base Case, returns bigger
