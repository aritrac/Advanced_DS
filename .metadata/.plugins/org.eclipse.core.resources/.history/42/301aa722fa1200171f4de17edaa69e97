/*
 * Question: A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one another's shoulders. For practical and aesthetic reasons,each person must be both
 * shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest possible number
 * of people in such a tower.
 * 
 * Solution: We have a list of pairs of items. Find the longest sequence such that both the first and second items are in non-decreasing order.
 * One thing we might first try is sorting the items on an attribute. This is useful actually, but it won't get us all the way there.
 * By sorting the items by height, we have a relative order the items must appear in. We still need to find the longest increasing subsequence of weight though.
 * In the recursive approach, we need to essentially try all the possibilities. After sorting by height, we iterate through the array. At each element, we branch into
 * two choices: add this element to the subsequence (if it's valid) or do not.
