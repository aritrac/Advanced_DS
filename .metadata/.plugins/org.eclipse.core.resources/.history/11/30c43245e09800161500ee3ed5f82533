/**
 * Question: String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1
 * and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g. "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat")
 * 
 * Solution: If we imagine that s2 is a rotation of s1, then we can ask what the rotation point is. For example, if you rotate waterbottle
 * after wat, you get erbottlewat. In a rotation, we cut s1 into two parts, x and y, and rearrange then to get s2
 * 
 * s1 = xy = waterbottle
 * x = wat
 * y = erbottle
 * s2 = yx = erbottlewat
 * 
 * So we need to check if there's a way to split s1 into x and y such that xy = s1 and yx = s2. Regardless of where the division between x and y
 * is, we can see that yx will always be a substring of xyxy. That is, s2 will always be a substring of s1s1.
 * And this is precisely how we solve the problem: simply do isSubstring(s1s1,s2). The code below implements the algorithm
