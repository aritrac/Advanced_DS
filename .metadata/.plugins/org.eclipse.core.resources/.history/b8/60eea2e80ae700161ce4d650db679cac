 * Question: You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of projects, where the second project is dependent on the first project.)
 * All of a project's dependencies must be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If there is no
 * valid build order, return an error.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * projects: a, b, c, d, e, f
 * dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c)
 * 
 * Output: f, e, a, b, d, c
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 1)Build a graph where each project is a node and its outgoing edges represent the projects that depend on it. That is, if A has an edge to B (A -> B), it means B has a dependency
 * on A and therefore A must be built before B. Each node also tracks the number of incoming edges.
 * 
 * 2)Initialize a buildOrder array. Once we determine a project's build order, we add it to the array. We also continue to iterate through the array, using a toBeProcessed
 * pointer to point to the next node to be fully processed.
 * 
 * 3)Find all the nodes with zero incoming edges and add those to a buildOrder array. Set a toBeProcessed pointer to the beginning of the array.
 * 
 * Repeat until toBeProcessed is at the end of the buildOrder
 * 
 * 1)Read node at toBeProcessed
 *  >>If node is null, then all remaining nodes have a dependency and we have detected a cycle
 * 2)For each child of node
 * 	>>Decrement child.dependencies (the number of incoming edges)
 *  >>If child.dependencies is zero, add child to end of buildOrder
 * 3)Increment toBeProcessed
 * 
 * The code below implements this algorithm
